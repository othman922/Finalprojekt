## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **Vite**: Vite is a fast, modern build tool for frontend development that provides an optimized development environment with blazing-fast hot module replacement (HMR) and speedy bundling.

- **React.js**: React.js is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It enables the creation of reusable UI components and provides efficient rendering capabilities.

- **Axios**: Axios is a promise-based HTTP client that simplifies making HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend. It supports features such as interceptors, request cancellation, and more.

- **Bootstrap**: Bootstrap is a widely-used CSS framework that provides a responsive grid system and a collection of pre-built components. It facilitates the development of mobile-friendly and visually appealing web pages.

- **EmailJS**: EmailJS is a service that allows the sending of emails directly from the frontend using JavaScript. It simplifies the process of integrating email functionality into the website.

### Backend

- **Express.js**: Express.js is a fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies the creation of robust APIs and server-side applications, enabling efficient handling of HTTP requests and responses.

- **MongoDB**: MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that provides a flexible and scalable solution for storing and retrieving data. It offers powerful querying capabilities and seamless integration with Node.js.

- **Cloudinary**: Cloudinary is a cloud-based media management platform that simplifies the storage, optimization, and delivery of images and videos. It offers various features like automatic image resizing and manipulation.

- **bcrypt**: bcrypt is a library used for password hashing. It provides a secure way to store passwords by applying a one-way hashing algorithm, making it difficult for attackers to reverse-engineer the original password.

- **JSON Web Token (JWT)**: JWT is a widely-used standard for creating access tokens that can securely transmit information between parties. It is commonly used for authentication and authorization purposes.

- **Mongoose**: Mongoose is an Object-Data Mapping (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a convenient way to interact with MongoDB, define data models, perform validations, and more.
